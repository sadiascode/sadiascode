# 👋 Hi, I'm a Junior Flutter Developer

 I’m passionate about building mobile applications that solve real-world problems.  
 Currently focusing on **Flutter UI**, **authentication flows**, and **clean app architecture**.  
 Learning every day and improving one feature, one bug fix, one refactor at a time.

---

##  My Development Journey

I started my journey as a Flutter developer with a strong interest in **mobile UI design** and **user experience**.  
At first, I focused on understanding Flutter basics—widgets, layouts, navigation, and state handling.

Over time, I began working on:
-  Authentication screens (Login, Signup, Validation)
-  Custom reusable widgets
-  Clean folder structure & reusable components
-  Understanding app flow and user behavior

I believe **small improvements every day lead to big growth** as a developer.
